üìñ Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a low-cost, portable educational oscilloscope and function signal generator, targeting students who require practical signal testing tools outside traditional labs.

Built on an STM32F407 microcontroller, the device supports:

Dual-channel signal measurement (oscilloscope mode)

Dual-channel waveform output (signal generator mode)

User interaction via a mouse encoder and buttons

Real-time display via a full-color screen

Type-C power input with external battery compatibility

The system was designed, tested, and packaged for offline self-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
